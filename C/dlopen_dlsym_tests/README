Proves how to call a function of the libc library inside a function defined in your custom library with the same name.

For example, we're defining a library with the time() function that it's also in libc. We want to call the libc time() function inside our time() function.

=== COMPILE ===
To compile the code you can check the compile.sh script.


=== USAGE ===
Usage: 

$ ./testTime #(use only the libc version of time())

$ LD_PRELOAD=./libtimelab.so ./testTime #(use the custom version of time() that calls the libc version of time() inside)
