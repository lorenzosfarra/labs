DESCRIPTION

this is a cellular automata framework, supporting concurrent threads to calculate the next status.
IT'S NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION!
Simple things to improve:
 1) Use pipelines for communication between threads;
 2) The algorithm to calculate which cells have to parse a single thread is not completely fair.
